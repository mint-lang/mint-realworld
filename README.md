# Mint Realworld

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [**Mint**](https://www.mint-lang.com) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

# How it works

This implemenation only uses the [Mint language](https://mint-lang.com) and it's standard library without any third party dependencies.

# Development Server

Follow these steps to get up and running:

1. Install Mint ( https://www.mint-lang.com/install )
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies with `mint install`
4. Start the development server `mint start`
6. That's it!

# Production Build

Just run `mint build` and everything is built into the `dist` folder.

# Running Tests

Just run `mint test` to run the sample tests.
